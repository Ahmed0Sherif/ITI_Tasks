     * adc_value is assumed to be a variable representing the raw ADC reading, and it's cast to an u32 (32-bit unsigned integer) to ensure the calculations are performed with sufficient precision.

	 * SENSOR_MAX_TEMPERATURE is representing the maximum temperature that the sensor can measure.

     * ADC_REF_VOLT_VALUE is representing the reference voltage of the ADC, which is used to convert the ADC reading to a voltage value.

     * ADC_MAXIMUM_VALUE is representing the maximum possible value that the ADC can return.

     * SENSOR_MAX_VOLT_VALUE is representing the maximum voltage value that the sensor can produce.

 *     "adc_value * SENSOR_MAX_TEMPERATURE" This operation is done to scale the ADC reading to the temperature range.

 *	   " * ADC_REF_VOLT_VALUE"  This operation converts the scaled ADC reading into a voltage value.

 *	   " / ADC_MAXIMUM_VALUE * SENSOR_MAX_VOLT_VALUE"   This step scales the voltage value down to a fractional value between 0 and 1, representing the relative position within the full range.

 *      the entire result is cast back to u8, which truncates the fractional part of the value and keeps only the integer part.
